PLACEHOLDER FOR GAME SCREENSHOT

This file is a placeholder for the screenshot.png file referenced in the README.md.

To create a proper screenshot:
1. Run the game locally using `npm run dev`
2. Take a screenshot of the game in action
3. Save it as "screenshot.png" in the root directory of the project
4. Replace this placeholder file with the actual screenshot

The screenshot should show the game interface with a question and multiple choice options to give users a preview of what the game looks like.
